## Structure

A brief overview over the theory files:
- `Syntax.thy` defines the main datastructures used to model the language.
  This includes the AST, the types, as well as auxiliary types to model e.g. type environments.
- `Utils.thy` defines various utility functions and auxiliar lemmas.
- `Semantics.thy` defines small-step operation semantics for the language, as well as denotational semantics for
   expressions and formulas.
- `Chomp.thy` defines the `chomp` and `heapRef_1` functions that are used to type the instance extraction command.
- `Types.thy` defines the main typing judgements, and gives various additional definitions relating to types, e.g. the
  subtyping relation.
- `Chomp_Correctness.thy` attempts to prove the correctness of the syntactic chomp operation.

## Progress

Defining all the relevant constructs took longer than hoped for; the main paper omits several definitions and others had
to be augmented to be suitable for formalization. As a consequence, I did not get all the way to proving the main theorems
of the paper in the scope of the project outside of course scope: Progress and Preservation, and therefore soundness of
the type system.

As of now, we have proofs for various auxiliary lemmas and a good chunk of the theorem showing correctness of the syntactic
chomp operation with respect to the semantic chomp operation. The lemmas used as stepping stones in this proof also
required a fair number of modifications over the original versions from the paper to actually be correct in all cases.
The proof also includes many subcases that are omitted in the paper; they are not as trivial as the paper assumes.
